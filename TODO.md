1. Add a default **settings.php** file to be used in the local development environments. This will be installed by the setup-new-localdev.sh script in the localdevsetup repo.
2. Add pushbullet for bash and notify-send
3. Also mount ~/.config/ so that we can get the pushbullet API key from the host.
4. Add localdev-wetkit-meos-reset.sh script
